<img hspace="20" align="right" src="coding.gif" width='500'/>

I am currently employed at [Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.](https://www.amd.com/en.html) as a Member of Technical Staff (MTS), where I focus on developing scalable, robust kernels for Generative AI models optimized for AMD's [AI Engine Block](https://www.xilinx.com/products/technology/ai-engine.html). Previously, I have worked at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research) as a Senior ML Engineer and [Amazon Lab126](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126/) Hardware Compute Group as a SysDE ML Compiler Engineer. I graduated with two research focussed masters from [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) in 2020 and an integrated dual degree from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2017. At present, I am concurrently finishing up my doctorate from [University of Texas, Austin](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) where my research focus is designing energy-efficient, robust, machine learning algorithms for generative AI edge applications.

I have a pet cat, Oliver. He is quite chonky &#128516; and a very good boy. Check out his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ollie.bear___/" target="_blank" title="ollie.bear___"><img hspace='1' src="instagram.svg" width='12'/></a>

## Skills

- Built the compiler stack that enabled seamless low-latency, high-throughput [generative AI inference on the edge](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/02/worlds-first-on-device-demonstration-of-stable-diffusion-on-android "Qualcomm AI Research deploys Stable Diffusion with 1B+ parameter foundation model on an edge device through full-stack AI optimization").
- Optimizing the software stack of inference devices that ensures AI computations on the edge while maininting throughput and reducing latency, eg. [processing voice commands on device](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/new-amazon-echo-devices-will-have-local-voice-processing-giving-users-more-privacy/ "New Amazon Echo devices have local voice processing").
- Algorithms and architecture co-design for AI accelerators focussed towards training/inference with lesser compute/energy budget. Published a paper in **ICASSP 2020**.
